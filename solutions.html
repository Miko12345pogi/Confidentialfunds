    <p class="section-text">
        Addressing the issues surrounding Confidential and Intelligence Funds (CIF) requires a balanced
        approach—one that protects national security while ensuring transparency, accountability, and ethical
        governance. Below are evidence-based and practical solutions that policymakers, agencies, and citizens
        can advocate for to strengthen oversight, restore public trust, and improve fund utilization.

<!-- SOLUTION 1 -->
<section class="section">
    <div class="block">
        <img src="images/Audit.png" alt="Auditing Mechanisms">
        <p>
            <b>1. Strengthen Independent Auditing Mechanisms</b><br><br>
            One of the most effective ways to ensure responsible use of CIF is to implement a specialized auditing
            framework. This does not require full public disclosure of sensitive operations but ensures that expenditures
            undergo confidential review by an empowered, independent auditing body. Such a system may include
            classified auditing sessions, encrypted documentation, and mandatory reporting to select oversight
            committees in Congress. Strengthened auditing prevents misuse and reassures the public that the funds are
            being used for their intended purposes—national security, intelligence, and law enforcement operations.

<!-- SOLUTION 2 -->
<section class="section">
    <div class="block reverse">
        <img src="images/allocation.png" alt="Fund Allocation">
        <p>
            <b>2. Restrict CIF Allocation to True Security Agencies</b><br><br>
            Allocating CIF only to agencies with legitimate security, intelligence, or law enforcement functions helps
            retain the integrity of the fund. This prevents non-security agencies from competing for CIF, allowing the
            budget to focus on units that truly require confidential operations. Clearer guidelines must define which
            institutions qualify, eliminating vague or overly broad interpretations. Through this, CIF becomes more
            focused, credible, and resistant to misuse or misallocation, ensuring that security functions remain the
            priority.

<!-- SOLUTION 3 -->
<section class="section">
    <div class="block">
        <img src="images/Transparency2.png" alt="Transparency Reports">
        <p>
            <b>3. Require Annual Transparency Reports</b><br><br>
            While CIF cannot be fully disclosed to the public, agencies can still provide general transparency reports
            summarizing the nature—not the specifics—of their operations. These can include broad descriptions of
            intelligence activities, threat assessments, operational improvements, or community security impacts.
            Providing these overviews increases public awareness, improves trust in institutions, and allows citizens to
            better understand how their taxes support national safety.

<!-- SOLUTION 4 -->
<section class="section">
    <div class="block reverse">
        <img src="images/Education.png" alt="Public Education">
        <p>
            <b>4. Promote Public Education and Civic Awareness</b><br><br>
            Political literacy is essential in ensuring that public debates on CIF remain informed, rational, and free from
            misinformation. Schools, universities, and media outlets can participate in creating materials and platforms
            that explain how CIF works, why it exists, and what safeguards should accompany its usage. When
            citizens understand the complexities of CIF, they are better equipped to hold leaders accountable and
            support policies grounded in evidence rather than speculation or political narratives.

    <div class="block">
        <img src="images/prior.png" alt="Budget Prioritization">
        <p>
            <b>5. Improve Budget Prioritization and Distribution</b><br><br>
            A responsible national budget must reflect the true needs of the country. Before allocating significant CIF,
            government agencies must thoroughly assess whether essential public services—such as education,
            healthcare, agriculture, infrastructure, and disaster preparedness—are adequately funded. A well-balanced
            budget ensures that intelligence work supports national development rather than overshadows it. By
            improving fund distribution, the government can demonstrate commitment to both public welfare and
            national security.

    <h2 class="section-title">Moving Forward: A Balanced & Accountable Approach</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
        Confidential and Intelligence Funds are powerful tools for protecting national security, but their misuse
        threatens democratic values, public trust, and institutional credibility. The solutions outlined above emphasize
        balance—strengthening the efficiency of intelligence work while ensuring public funds remain accountable.
        Through informed policymaking, transparent governance, and civic engagement, the Philippines can ensure
        that CIF achieves its true purpose: safeguarding the nation while upholding integrity, justice, and responsible
        leadership.
