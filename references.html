    <p class="section-text">
        In political and civic discussions, citing credible sources is essential to maintaining truth, integrity, and
        responsible information sharing. Proper citations ensure that arguments are grounded in evidence rather than
        hearsay. They allow readers to cross-check facts, avoid misinformation, and participate in informed civic
        dialogue. By citing reliable government institutions, established news agencies, and reputable organizations,
        this website upholds academic honesty and encourages critical thinking among its readers.
