    <p class="section-text">
        Confidential and Intelligence Funds (CIF) are budget allocations given to government agencies to support
        security-sensitive operations. These include surveillance, intelligence gathering, and investigations.
        However, due to their secretive nature, they escape detailed public scrutiny and standard auditing. 
        As the Philippines continues to face issues involving transparency, corruption, and political conflict, 
        debates about CIF have become louder and more contentious. This website provides a comprehensive,
        clear, and well-structured educational discussion on the topic.
